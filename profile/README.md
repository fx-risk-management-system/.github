## 🧭 Overview

The **FX Risk Management System** is a real-time platform for monitoring, analyzing, and mitigating foreign exchange (FX) risks in financial institutions. It leverages high-throughput stream processing, microservices architecture, and time-series analytics to provide insights and automation around FX rate fluctuations, client exposure, and market volatility.

Designed to integrate easily with external data sources, the system can ingest data from market feeds, banking systems, and analytics platforms, while exposing secure REST APIs for downstream consumption.

---

## 🌐 Use Cases

- Continuous FX rate and volatility monitoring
- Real-time client exposure tracking
- Automated alerting and notification for risk events
- Data-driven hedging strategy recommendations
- Seamless integration with banking systems, trading platforms, and compliance dashboards

Y## 💡 **Architecture Explanation & Subsystem Use Cases**

This architecture represents a **real-time FX (foreign exchange) risk management system**. It ingests live data, processes it using stream analytics, applies business logic, stores the results, and presents it to users via APIs and dashboards.

---

### 1. **🔗 External Data Sources**

> **What it is:** These are upstream systems that feed the platform with raw data.

#### Components:

* `FX Market Data APIs`: Provides live exchange rates (e.g., USD/EUR).
* `Core Banking System`: Supplies client account and transaction data.
* `Client Transactions`: Specific FX trades made by customers.
* `Market Analytics`: Derived data like news sentiment or economic indicators.

#### ✅ Use Case:

* A customer books an FX deal; the system gets both the client transaction and market rate from external sources to compute real-time exposure.

---

### 2. **🚀 Data Ingestion Layer (Kafka)**

> **What it is:** Kafka acts as the central nervous system for asynchronous, high-throughput messaging.

#### Topics:

* `fx-market-data`: Streams real-time FX prices.
* `client-fx-positions`: Streams client trades and current holdings.
* `fx-alerts`: Streams alerts related to risk thresholds or anomalies.
* `fx-volatility`: Streams metrics like price volatility per currency pair.

#### ✅ Use Case:

* New exchange rates hit the `fx-market-data` topic; multiple downstream processors consume it for risk and hedging calculations.

---

### 3. **🧮 Stream Processing Layer (Apache Flink)**

> **What it is:** Real-time data computation engine for analytics and alerting.

#### Processors:

* `FX Rate Processor`: Cleans and normalizes rates (e.g., average over 5s).
* `Volatility Calculator`: Computes standard deviation or implied vol.
* `Position Risk Detector`: Calculates risk per client using positions + market data.
* `Alert Generator`: Flags anomalies or high exposure.

#### ✅ Use Case:

* If a client’s position in GBP/USD exceeds \$1M and volatility spikes, the Alert Generator emits a warning.

---

### 4. **🧠 Business Logic Layer (Spring Boot Microservices)**

> **What it is:** Stateless services that apply domain logic and orchestration.

#### Services:

* `FX Market Data Service`: Publishes latest FX rates.
* `Risk Analytics Service`: Computes and exposes client risk profiles.
* `Hedging Recommendation Service`: Suggests trades to mitigate exposure.
* `Position Tracking Service`: Keeps position snapshots for each client.
* `Notification Service`: Sends alerts via email, SMS, or UI.

#### ✅ Use Case:

* After detecting exposure, the Risk Analytics Service calls the Hedging Service to recommend a EUR/USD hedge using forwards.

---

### 5. **🗄 Data Storage Layer**

> **What it is:** Databases optimized for different data access patterns.

#### Datastores:

* `PostgreSQL`: Stores client info and transaction logs.
* `Redis`: Low-latency cache for FX rates used by APIs.
* `TimescaleDB`: Time-series storage of rates and risk metrics.
* `Elasticsearch`: Full-text searchable alerts and logs.

#### ✅ Use Case:

* A query for a client’s position risk over the past 24 hours fetches data from TimescaleDB for charting.

---

### 6. **🌐 API & UI Layer**

> **What it is:** REST APIs and dashboards for clients, admins, and notifications.

#### Interfaces:

* `REST APIs`: Public/internal APIs exposing positions, risks, and rates.
* `Client Dashboard`: Web UI for clients to track their FX exposure.
* `Admin Console`: Risk managers monitor client-wide risk metrics.
* `Notification UI`: Alert console with filtering and triaging.

#### ✅ Use Case:

* A client logs into the dashboard and views a real-time chart of their FX exposure, fed by Redis + TimescaleDB through REST APIs.

## 🔄 Data Flow Example (End-to-End)

Let’s walk through a full use case:

> **Scenario:** A client trades \$1M in EUR/USD, market volatility rises sharply.

1. `ClientTxn` sends the trade event to `client-fx-positions` Kafka topic.
2. `FXDataAPI` pushes a new EUR/USD price to `fx-market-data` topic.
3. `Volatility Calculator` detects a volatility jump.
4. `Position Risk Detector` flags the client’s exposure as high.
5. `Alert Generator` pushes an alert to `fx-alerts`.
6. `Risk Analytics Service` updates the client’s profile.
7. `Hedging Service` generates a suggestion to hedge \$1M in USD/JPY.
8. Alert is stored in `Elasticsearch` and sent via the `Notification Service`.
9. Client sees the update on their dashboard via REST API.
